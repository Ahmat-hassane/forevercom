I want you to build a modern, professional, and responsive website for a creative agency whose main activities are Communication Digitale, Conception graphique, Imprimerie, Management, Événementiel, and Formations. The main goal of the website is to clearly present these services in a clean, minimalist design with an elegant and modern user experience.

The website must be built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with GSAP integrated for smooth scrolling effects, text animations, and section reveals. All code should be written in French, including the use of lang="fr" in the HTML <html> tag, and all visible content, labels, and metadata must be in French.

The color palette should use orange as the primary color, blue as the secondary color, and white as the background, with a mobile-first responsive layout.

The site should include the following pages:

index.html (Accueil)

services.html (Services)

projets.html (Projets)

a-propos.html (À propos)

contact.html (Contact)

Each page must include SEO-friendly tags such as French titles, meta descriptions, alt text for images, and Open Graph metadata in French.

The Accueil page should feature:

A hero section with animated titles

An overview of services

A project showcase

The Services page should clearly present the six main activities with short descriptions and visuals.

The Projets page should display a responsive grid of projects with animations triggered on scroll.

The À propos page should highlight the agency’s mission, vision, and team.

The Contact page must include a contact form that allows visitors to send messages. The form should:

Be processed using PHP (contact.php)

Include client-side validation with JavaScript

Include server-side validation with PHP

Send the message to a specified email address

Also generate the required SEO files:

robots.txt

sitemap.xml

The folder structure must be organized with separate directories for CSS, JavaScript, and images, and include only the following files:

Code
index.html
services.html
projets.html
a-propos.html
contact.html
contact.php
robots.txt
sitemap.xml
/assets/css/styles.css
/assets/js/script.js
/assets/img/ (empty or with placeholder references)
⚠️ Do not generate any additional files beyond those listed above.

The final result should be a fully functional website that is visually modern, accessible, SEO-optimized, and deployable on Hostinger, with all content and code written in French.
